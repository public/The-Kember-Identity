Kember Identity
===============

This code is loosely based on the CUDA MD5 code at http://majuric.org/software/cudamd5/

It is distributed under GPLv2.

If you don't have a very fast CUDA capable card you are still probably better off with
MDcrack, or a combination of both.

Requirements & building
=======================

Make sure you have the CUDA SDK installed and compiled in ~/NVIDIA_CUDA_SDK.
This code uses the cutil library from the SDK.

Then do:

	make

Usage
=====

Start at a random hash
  ./cuda_md5 --kember

Start at a specific high 64-bit word
  ./cuda_md5 --kember=1

Set the low half
  ./cuda_md5 --kember=1 --kember-resume=1
